      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Think about your favorite kind of music. A lot of people will say pop, lots of people will say rap, lots of people in Idaho would say country too. But talking about the first two, pop and rap, a lot of the songs that are coming out now are kind of blurring the line between those two genres. Its formed a new genre, called RnB. "Rhythm and beats". I plan on making an informational website about the different artists and songs, so that people can understand this newgenre better, and even get more interested!</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Everyone wanting to break into the musical genre of RnB!</p>  <!-- change this -->
