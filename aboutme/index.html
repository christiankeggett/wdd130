    <h2>Christian Eggett</h2>
    <p> Hey everyone! I'm Christian, and I'm studying software engineering. This
        is my second here here at BYUI, and I really enjoy it. I'm from Rexburg,
        so I am pretty familiar with this town as well. I grew up in the church,
        and I served a mission in Paraguay. I really like pickleball, and I'm 
        getting better at basketball.I've alwasy been really interested in web 
        design, and so I'm super excited for this class. I'm interested to see 
        if this will be a good career path for me.
    </p>
